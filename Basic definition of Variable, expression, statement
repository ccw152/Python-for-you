                                      Define a variable 

• A variable is a named place in the memory where a programmer can store data and later retrieve the data using the variable “name”
  (A variable is a memory location used to store a value)
• Programmers get to choose the names of the variables
• You can change the contents of a variable in a later statement

                              Definition of statment and expression 
       
• We assign a value to a variable using the assignment statement (=)
• An assignment statement consists of an expression on the right-hand side and a variable to store the result
 ie. x=2  (Assignment statement)
     x=x+2 print x. (Assignment with expression, right-hand side)
