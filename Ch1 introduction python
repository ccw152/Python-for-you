	  To start off any programming language, one could follow the outline of learning Trajectory
  - variable (words) -> valid synthax pattern (sentence) -> construct structure (paragraph). It works like how to learn a second language.  

	  There are two way to talk with python, which are interactive and Script
  a.) Interactive > You type directly to Python one line at a time and it responds 
  b.) Script > You enter a sequence of statements (lines) into a file using a text editor and tell Python to execute the statements in the file  

    Although, interactive Python is good for experiments and programs of 3-4 lines long. Most programs are much longer, so we type them into a file and tell  
  Python to run the commands in the file. In a sense, we are “giving Python a script”. 
  
  PS: As a convention, we add “.py” as the suffix on the end of these files to indicate they contain Python.
